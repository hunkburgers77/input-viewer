Input Viewer is software for logging and displaying all input from the user's mouse and keyboard. 

We prioritize user safety, support, and reliability. If you encounter any bugs or issues, please let us know, and weâ€™ll do our best to address them.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Is this malware?**

**A:** `No`. The source code is fully visible to everyone, making it virtually impossible for anything malicious to be added without being noticed. Just make sure you download it from an official source. You can also inspect the `.exe` file yourself using `Resource Hacker` by checking the `RCData` section. We have nothing to hide, but we still encourage you to take all necessary precautions when using this software.

**Q: Can using this get me banned / flag AV or AC?**

**A:** `No`, it shouldn't. Input Viewer does not interact with any game client in the way that exploits or cheats do. It simply records keystrokes and mouse inputs, then outputs them to a file.
